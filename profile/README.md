# Community Day

## What is a Community Day?

A Community Day is a semi-formalized practice for approaching the stewardship of open source
projects in a way that ensures regular interaction with contributors while being able to commit to
planned work. In short, the maintainers have picked a cadence where they spend an entire working
day only working on Community-sourced items - getting PRs merged, triaging issues, hosting office
hours, etc.

## Why is a Community Day?

When teams work on open source projects, especially when those teams are employed by an
organization, there's always a tension between the team's committed priorities and keeping up with
the contributions from their broader community.

Sometimes, teams try to address this tension by treating them as functionally identical priorities.
Unfortunately, that usually ends up with the team _actually_ prioritizing one or the other and never
resolving the tension.

Sometimes, teams agree to pull community-sourced work into their normal workflow, prioritizing it
and pulling it into their planning and execution cycles. Unfortunately, it's only rarely that _all_
community-sourced work gets pulled in and items that don't get pulled in often gets lost or stalled
for an indeterminate amount of time.

## How is a Community Day?

A Community Day is an alternative to never prioritizing community-sourced work or treating it as the
same as internally-sourced work. Instead, teams adopting the Community Day model pick a regular
cadence for when they dedicate their time exclusively to working on community-sourced and related
work.

While the way a team runs their Community Day should always be tailored to their specific context,
there are a few broader processes that have emerged from various teams that can be very useful.

- Everyone on the team participates in Community Day. This ensures that everyone is available for
  the work and can collaborate/ping each other for help without impacting committed work. It also
  helps build context for the community-sourced work across the team instead of requiring whichever
  members are looking at the issues to share the context during the rest of the work cycle.
- Start by addressing pull requests.
  - If a PR can be merged with little work on Community Day, it should be.
  - If a PR requires more than an hour of work, decide whether the team is committing to getting it
    merged before the next triage cycle or if they're going to request the contributor to do the
    work. Communicate the decision to the contributor either way. If the team is adopting the PR,
    make sure to follow through or update the contributor as soon as you know the PR won't be merged
    before the next cycle.
  - Where possible, assign the contributor's PR to _someone_ so the team and the contributor both
    understand who is accountable for following up on reviewing the work and helping the contributor
    get it ready to merge.
- Triage issues.
  - Focus first on items filed since the last community day, then work from the oldest issues to
    newest.
  - The goal is to either:
    1. Get the issue to a workable state. An issue is workable when it has enough information and
       clarity to be picked up by a community contributor or prioritized to be assigned to a team
       member.
    1. Understand the issue well enough to close it if the team believes it should be closed.
- Host an office hours or similar event to give synchronous time to community members. This gives
  the community members a chance to talk to or get help from the team in a structured and time-boxed
  format and can help them contribute more effectively or surface needs and issues to the team that
  normal asynchronous channels may not always capture. It also helps to solidify the relationship
  between the team and the community by regular interaction.
- Publish a team blog post towards the end of the day highlighting contributions and sharing any
  regular updates for repositories the team is responsible for, lessons learned, etc. With the full
  team available, merging Pull Requests and marking issues as up-for-grabs or committing them to the
  normal work list, Community Day is a good time to write a blog post without impacting other work
  items.

## When is a Community Day?

We _recommend_ a weekly cadence for open source projects which have a large community or backlog,
but other schedules - every-other-week, monthly, whatever works for your team - can work well. What
we have found is that having a _regular_ cadence is at least as important as how often the team
holds a Community Day.

We have found that people are often willing to wait to have their issues or pull requests addressed
_so long as_ they have a clear understanding of when and how the team is going to address those
items.

## Where is a Community Day?

We've found that virtual co-working with tools like [Gather][gather-town] and [Discord][discord]
during Community Day really helps the team.

Whether you physically or virtually colocate, being able to dynamically sync, drop, and form small
groups to discuss and share context with low overhead is key. As much as working directly on the
community-sourced work is important, Community Day is also a great opportunity to share context and
grow the skills of the team by talking through issues and helping one another without worrying about
whether questions are "distracting" the other person from their committed work.

## Who is Community Day?

Hopefully, you! This organization page is a living document authored and maintained by folks who
have run or practiced Community Days as a part of their work. If you're interested in getting your
team or project listed, please [file an issue][new-issue] and we'll be happy to add you to a list of
folks who have adopted Community Day as a part of your open source stewardship.
